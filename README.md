You can find me on my [digital garden](https://www.tiagofsanchez.com/), where I write about all sorts of things code, tech and life related.

Currently I am building [framsup](https://framesup.netlify.app/) where you will be able to find a bunch of tools and tricks that can help you understand if you new idea is great or not and how you should go about building it. 

Hope to see you around.
