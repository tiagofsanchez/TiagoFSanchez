You can find me on my [digital garden](https://www.tiagofsanchez.com/), where I write about all sorts of things code, tech, product and life related - really anything.

# Ongoing building

Currently I am building [Roam The Lineup](https://www.roamthelineup.com/), helping surfers find their next surf trip!
