All organizations struggle width the endless debate over outcomes and outputs. 

What should we prioritize? Should we focus only on outcomes? Or should we only consider outputs and delivery whatever is being asked? 

From a product management perspective this is super important mostly because resources are finite and one should prioritize outcomes over outputs as they will be the driving force of long term value for an organization. A couple of weeks ago I put a couple of thoughts on paper on a post about the topic [Outcomes or Outputs](/blog/2022-03-30-product-roadmap-outcomes-or-outputs) but this continues to puzzle me, and I suspect that I am not alone.

No one disagrees about the importance of driving business results or business outcomes in an organization, the big challenge is translating that across the different functions across the company in a sensible manner. Normally Commercial teams obsess about deals and revenue, Marketing thinks about organic and inorganic traffic and market share, Product looks at conversions
