All organizations struglle witdh the endless debate over outcomes and outputs. 

What should we prioritize? Should we focus exclusevely around outcomes? Or should we only consider outupts and delivery? 

From a product management perspective this is super important mostly because resources are finite and one should prioritize outcomes over outputs as they will be the driving force of long term value for an organization. A couple of weeks ago I put a couple of thoughts on paper on a post about the topic [Outcomes or Outputs](/blog/2022-03-30-product-roadmap-outcomes-or-outputs) and this continues to puzzle me, and I suspect that I am not alone.
