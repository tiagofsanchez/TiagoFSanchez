Another year has gone by and the world changed so much. 

Working from home is a mainstream thing, covid doesn't go away and travel has became a painful (and very expensive) experience.

Last year I wrote a year-end post, [2020 into 2021, we made it ...](/blog/2020-12-31-2020-into-2021/) and it was fun to go back and read it, so this year I will be putting together a couple of thoughts about what happened in 2021 and what is next for 2022.


# üë∑ Companies still grapple with WFH

Despite the fact that the large majority of people are working from home and all the opportunities that came with it, I believe companies are still strugeling with this new reality. 

Most companies are not equiped to work remotely, others don't understand that replicating the synchronous office type of work and shoehorn that into multiple video calls throughout the day is not effective. And for same the culture shift and management style is holding them back, not allowing them to take advantage of the biggest workplace experiment that ever happened.

Personally I believe that anyone that is serious about what they do need to engage in deep work that will only be achieved with a strong [asynchronous collaboration](/blog/2021-03-06-asynchronous-collaboration/) culture. For this to happend however, organisations need to foster and enable that and stop trying to replicate the synchronous type of live we use to have the office. 

The true winners will be the companies that will able to tap into this new ways of working. For reference below I share a couple of thoughts that I put together at the begining of Covid: 

- [The future of work needs smart collaboration](/blog/2020-05-10-the-future-of-work-needs-smart-collaboration)
- [The future of work needs a better communication tool](/blog/2020-05-05-the-future-of-work-needs-a-better-communication%20tool)
- [The future of work needs to give you back your schedule](/blog/2020-05-18-the-future-of-work-needs-to-give-you-back-your-schedule)

# üöÄ I got a new side gig

I started to code about 4 years ago, seriously about 2 and since then I have learned a lot. The 


# ‚úçÔ∏è I didn't write has much

My new side gig required a lot of attention and as a result I wrote less here, but way more code üòú. 

<GardenStats2021 />

The fact that I have written less doesn't necessarily mean that this is less important. I reckon it is quite the oppositive. My new side gig is a result of engaging in the creative process and habit of writing and thinking out load, not being afraid of not acting and just start something. 

As I mention in my post [you should have a digital garden](/blog/2020-07-06-you-should-have-a-digital-garden/) the idea of engaging in the creative process of writing something, no matter the level of quality, can eventually lead to something bigger. I hope that my thesis is currect and that my new side gig will eventually lead to something bigger.

# ‚úà We went on holidays to Portugal

For obvious reasons I do have to mention this: we managed to travel for holidays in 2020 and despite the fact it now feels like this was ages ago, we were super lucky with our little trip to Bohol, in the Philippines. 

We manage to snorkel with the kids, got sunburned, ate great food and travel through Bohol in a tricycle motorbike. It was fantastic, back then something normal to us, now so foreigner that I don't remember a world where we can travel anymore. 

I can't even grasp all the challenges that all those beautiful people we meet along the way are going through without tourism? The lack of healthcare infrastructure was also visible as we literally where in the middle of nowhere - I only hope that they are all fine.

# ü¶† We did 7 day quarentine in Singapore

We landed back in Singapore to a completely different reality: Covid-19 was here, it was a reality the moment it started to take people's lives away, changing the way we socialize and imposing fear on the world. Back then I had no idea that this would last so long, that our living room would be our kid's school, our office, our clinic, our cinema, our everything. 

For the few lucky ones (I consider myself a lucky one) this will be the new reality for the foreseeable future, for the not so lucky ones, the ones that can't afford staying at home the new reality probably means that they would be living in constant fear as they have to hit the streets to go to work. For naysayers this will probably mean that they will take Twitter, Facebook or any other social media to voice their opinions and disbelieves. 

The world has changed and will not be the same anymore irrespective of what we believe and think.

On the back of going through all this, I decided to put my web dev learnings to good use and build [crushingwfh](https://crushingwfh.com/), a simple repository with tools that can help anyone to better work from home.  I also started to obsess a bit with the Covid-19 numbers and as a result of that begun to volunteer for [the covid tracking project](https://covidtracking.com/) were I was helping with building and maintaining their website.  



# üíª Started my #100DayProject

I have a terrible memory and pretty much like Dory, I forget everything new that I learn. The psychologist **Herman Eddinghaus** was one of the first people to study the 24hr memory drainage and the fact that we forget pretty much 2/3 of what we learn in 24 hours. 

This was shocking to me as this basically means that we all are wasting our time with something that will not stick in our minds. However, **Eddinghaus** also offers some advice on how to fight this memory drainage: 
- Repeated learning sessions over a longer interval improve memory retention of a subject;
- Topics at the beginning and the end of a session are most easily to be remembered;
- Any material that is studied beyond mastery is remembered longer.

In short, this was my motivation to start my #100DayProject as I wanted to learn more about web development and didn't want to forget about everything. (if you want to read more about this you can [check the post](/blog/2020-08-20-about-having-a-100-day-project-mindset/) where I explain a little bit more on that) - 
[Framusp](https://www.framsup.com/) was the project born of this experiment and I have to confess that I a pretty happy with all the things I learned on the back of that.

I hope that I can retain some of it.


# üë®‚Äçüë®‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ The kiddos are growing fast (and we don't even notice)

As any parent will attest to, their kids grow fast... like super fast and we don't even notice. This year even though we were together 24/7 it was no different. If anything, I reckon that accentuated the feeling mostly because we were with them all day long whilst we jumped from one call to another. And then we stopped, it was Christmas and the Year was coming to an end. The weeks were blended with the weekends and then the months felt pretty much the same.

The attention economy and all the business built around the principle were clear winners as digital engagement went through the roofs and we seemed to have lost the ability to be here and now, often with our kids, family and friends. The way that these things are designed and the way humans are hardwired doesn't necessarily help us and at the end of the day it make us easier to be hacked and manipulated - I expand on this topic on the post [The most important problem of our times](/blog/2020-10-12-the-most-important-problem/)      

For me, I wish less endless scrolling, less phone screen time and more here and now. It seems trivial, however challenging to achieve. 



# ü•á We made it live to 2021 

![loading](../thumbnails/2020_into_2021.png)

Yes, we made it to 2021 and in this case we should all be happy. I guess. And we are, there is a positiveness to it, a good feeling with starting something new, the turning of the page in a new book. You feel excited, looking forward to the next chapter. And for most of us that could be true, but we are not all working in the knowledge economy. 

It is, however, a misleading cliche to think that this situation and what happened will treat everyone equally. Though most people complain, being able to work from home is a luxury that only a few have. If you start to peel back the layers on reality you will find that covid-19 has not only put a magnifying glass on inequality but also is entrenching inequalities further and unfortunately it will take time to repair the damage of 2020.

Personally I am happy that we made it through, but conscious that we have to do better next year.
