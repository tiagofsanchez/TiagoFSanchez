Another year has gone by and the world changed so much. 

Working from home is a mainstream thing, covid doesn't go away and travel has became a painful (and very expensive) experience.

Last year I wrote a year-end post, [2020 into 2021, we made it ...](/blog/2020-12-31-2020-into-2021/) and it was fun to go back and read it, so this year I will be putting together a couple of thoughts about what happened in 2021 and what is next for 2022.


# üë∑ Companies still grapple with WFH

Despite the fact that the large majority of people are working from home and all the opportunities that came with it, I believe companies are still strugeling with this new reality. 

Most companies are not equiped to work remotely, others don't understand that replicating the synchronous office type of work and shoehorn that into multiple video calls throughout the day is not effective. And for same the culture shift and management style is holding them back, not allowing them to take advantage of the biggest workplace experiment that ever happened.

Personally I believe that anyone that is serious about what they do need to engage in deep work that will only be achieved with a strong [asynchronous collaboration](/blog/2021-03-06-asynchronous-collaboration/) culture. For this to happend however, organisations need to foster and enable that and stop trying to replicate the synchronous type of live we use to have the office. 

The true winners will be the companies that will able to tap into this new ways of working. For reference below I share a couple of thoughts that I put together at the begining of Covid: 

- [The future of work needs smart collaboration](/blog/2020-05-10-the-future-of-work-needs-smart-collaboration)
- [The future of work needs a better communication tool](/blog/2020-05-05-the-future-of-work-needs-a-better-communication%20tool)
- [The future of work needs to give you back your schedule](/blog/2020-05-18-the-future-of-work-needs-to-give-you-back-your-schedule)

# üöÄ Roam The Lineup - a new side gig 

<img src={rtl} alt="roam the lineup logo" style={{margin: `auto`}}/>


I started to code about 3 years ago, more seriously about 2 years ago and since then I have learned a lot. There are several different reasons why I started, but the main one is to be able to use this skill to test new ideas and potentialy, who knows, start a new business.

Last year I started a [#100DayProject](/blog/2020-10-05-launching-my-100-day-project), started to learn in ["public"](/blog/2020-09-04-learning-in-public) and got into a different mindset with regards to starting something new, something that you don't necessarily know that is going to work. Simply put you need to start somewhere and learn throughout the process, not the other way around. 

This year I started what I would say to be my most challenging side gig and in August I launched [Roam The Lineup](https://www.roamthelineup.com/). Imagine Airbnb for surfers with listings from the most amazing surf camps and surf houses out. Imagine also that, as a surfer, you now are able to know the location of the different surf camps in context to the waves that you like the most - there you go, that is Roam The Lineup in a nutshell.

I am trying to create something that would help surfers plan for their next surf trip, where they can decide where to go depending on the waves they want to surf, the expected surf conditions and seasonality. What's more, with Roam The Lineup, they will be able to check the different surf camps and surf houses, learn more about the teams that run their business, type of accommodations and who is their target customer base. 

This side hustle started with my passion for surf where I am "hacking" my way through solving a problem that I often had when planning for my surf trips. At the end of the day I am trying to build local knowledge for a global market while helping the surf community. 


# ‚úçÔ∏è I didn't write has much

My new side gig required a lot of attention and as a result I wrote less here, but way more code üòú in my side project. 

<GardenStats2021 />

The fact that I have written less doesn't necessarily mean that this is less important. I reckon it is quite the oppositive. My new side gig is a result of engaging in the creative process and habit of writing and thinking out load, not being afraid of acting and just start something. 

As I mention in my post [you should have a digital garden](/blog/2020-07-06-you-should-have-a-digital-garden/) the idea of engaging in the creative process of writing something, no matter the level of quality, can eventually lead to something bigger. I hope that my thesis is currect and that my new side gig will eventually lead to something bigger.

# ‚úà We went on holidays to Portugal

We went back to Portugal. We needed to.

Like so many people out there, we have hit the pause button of life and for about 2 years, we didn't hug our parents, they haven't seen how much their grandkids have grown, our kids have blurred memories of their family and we missed all of that. We missed our families, our friends and our home country. 

We needed to go. 

And so we did. We booked our trip... We didn't know when we would be able to return as Portugal, despite of having a very high vacination rate, was still not on the list of countries Singapore was allowing people return from. We gambled, fully aware that we could be stuck in Portugal. 

We landed in Portugal. 

It is hard to put into words the feeling of seeing your kids jumping around, climbing our parents in pure awe whilst tears were slowly sliding through their faces. It has been 2 years and we have been dreaming about this moment. We were home and the gamble already paid off. We were stoked to realize that our kids were as excited as we were.

Two weeks in, and Portugal was on the list of countries that Singapore accepted. At the time we were expected to do 14 days quarentine in a hotel, it was possible to return. One more week in, and Portugal was in the list of countries that could do home quarentine. The situation was very fluid but it could go both ways. We were lucky though. The number of covid cases were slowing down and the Singapore government decided for 7 day home quarentine for people coming from Portugal. 

The gamble pay off. 

We reconnected with familly and friends, I was able to surf, reconnected with the sea and had an amazing time. It was refreshing and we came back with a new sense of hope that will certainly help as we head towards 2022. We were very lucky.

I truly appreciate the support that my company gave me. They allow me to go, and for 1 month I was able to work from Portugal while staying with my family - for that thank you.


# ü•á We made it to 2022 

Yes, we made it to 2022. 

What a strange year 2021 was; Covid doesn't go away, inflation rates are on the rise propelled by crazzy energy prices, we are going through the [great resignation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Resignation) and it feels that the gap between wealthy and poor is getting wider and wider. Not a great way to start 2022, but unfortunately that's what we have. 

My selfish and only wish for 2022 is that covid magically disapears and that we are able to return to a normality, whatever that means.
